          <h2>“Kallun your nudo is ready!"</h2>
          <p>
            Now and again we get people curiously asking how the name ‘Nudo’
            came about.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name bears great significance dating back from my early
            childhood memories. As a British born Chinese, I was raised by my
            parents whom had migrated to the UK as first generation Chinese. It
            took my parents a while to get accustomed to learning and speaking
            English. Through my recollection of them speaking any word of it in
            those days was small, I quite simply recalled them speaking only in
            broken English!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a young child I loved food, but my favorite even to this day has
            to be noodles. Knowing I enjoyed noodles so much my parents, most
            occasions, before they prepared noodles to eat would tease and
            shout, “Kallun your nudo is ready!”

            <h2>Starting with Nudo Noodle House</h2>

          <h2>Then, Nudo Sushi Box!</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the North East’s diverse food culture – and as the
            popularity of sushi has soared of late – we felt that the next
            logical step for us was to introduce a unique and easy to order
            sushi menu onto the high street.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to sushi, it can sometimes be hard to find good
            quality on the go; so we made Nudo Sushi Box! Our aim is to make
            sushi a regular, healthy treat as opposed to an occasional luxury.
            We offer distinctive, unique and beautifully prepared foods at
            affordable prices.
