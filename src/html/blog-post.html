        <h2>What you’ll need</h2>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 carrot</li>
          <li>1 cucumber</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sharp knife</li>
          <li>Carving knife</li>
          <li>Wooden chopping board</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Step 1: Cutting the carrot</h2>
        <p>
          Take a fresh carrot and cut off a piece of 4 cm from the top. Usually
          this part of the carrot is thrown away, but now we’re going to use it
          for making a rose. Peel it using a sharp knife. Peeling it is not
          required for eating the carrot. This is mainly to make the end result
          look better. After peeling, cut of a small piece from the top. Now
          you’ve got a good piece of carrot to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./images/blog-articles/carrot-rose-tutorial/1.jpg"
            alt=""
            title=""
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Step 2: Carving the rose</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s start with the first petal. Using a carving knife, stick the
          knife about 1 cm into the carrot, just under the top. Slanting
          downwards, cut a sort of wave form with a length of a quarter of the
          circumference of the carrot. Make the same cut slightly under this one
          and remove the flesh that’s in between these cuts. You’ve just cut out
          the first petal. Now make the petal as thin as possible by cutting off
          the flesh on top of the first cut you just made. Note: in this case,
          it may help you a lot to have a look at the video, to see how it’s
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat this procedure. Start 1 cm to the right of the first cut you
          made, move the knife slightly under the first petal and finish halfway
          under this petal. Continue until there are petals all around the
          carrot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you need to make sure the petals will curve inwards. For this, cut
          of some flesh from the top at a 45 degree angle. Do this all around
          the top. Then, using the same wave form cuts, make the last petals.
          Make them slightly smaller than the first petals, to create a natural
          effect. Continue cutting out petals until there’s no room for more.
          Keep in mind that you need to do all this very gently, as if you’re
          working with real rose petals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last petals – at the top of the rose you’re making – are almost
          impossible to make. So, don’t try. Instead, just make a few small
          jagged cuts. This will make it look like small petals.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Step 3: Creating the calyx</h2>
        <p>
          The calyx, stem and leaves will be cut from a cucumber. Start with the
          calyx, by making 4 cuts all around the flat end of the cucumber. Cut
          at a slight angle and start 5 cm from the end. These cuts will become
          4 green leaves. Then cut off the piece of cucumber, but don’t cut
          through the leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a small knife, cut out a V-shape in between the leaves you cut
          earlier. Cut until you reach the middle of the cucumber. Then remove
          the flesh you’ve just cut out. If necessary, scrape out the rest. Of
          course, make sure you don’t damage the leaves on the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          You now created a kind of cup, with leaves on the outside. Use the
          knife point to cut out a small hole at the bottom. This is to connect
          the stem, which you’ll make in the next step.
        </p>
        <p>

            alt=""
            title=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./images/blog-articles/carrot-rose-tutorial/5.jpg"
            alt=""
            title=""
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Step 4: Creating the stem</h2>
        <p>
          Cut out a thin V-shaped piece from the cucumber. Make it as long as
          the cucumber, to get a nice long stem. Put aside for later.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./images/blog-articles/carrot-rose-tutorial/6.jpg"
            alt=""
            title=""
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Step 5: Creating leaves</h2>
        <p>
          Cut of a slice of the side of the cucumber, 7 or 8 cm long, 2 cm wide
          and 0.5 cm thick. Cut out a leaf shape. Then cut a vein through the
          middle. You can do this by first making a very shallow cut from top to
          bottom. Then angle the knife slightly and make the same cut. Pull out
          the flesh inside these cuts. This way the main vein is clearly
          visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the main vein, do the same at a 45 degrees angle a number of
          times. This creates the side veins. Repeat all this to make more
          leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img

            alt=""
            title=""
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Step 6: Assembling the rose</h2>
        <p>
          Make a small but deep hole at the bottom of the carrot rose. It needs
          to be deep to be able to hold the stem inside it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now pull the stem through the whole in the cucumber cup. Stick one
          side of the stem into the whole at the bottom of the carrot rose. Cut
          out a very small V-shaped piece of cucumber. You can use this to wedge
          it in the carrot hole next to the stem, to keep the stem in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Press the carrot rose into the cucumber calyx. Put the whole
          construction flat onto a plate. Add one or two leaves and you’ve done
          it! You just created a beautiful carrot rose. You can even eat it,
          although it’s probably better to simply enjoy the look of it.
        </p>
